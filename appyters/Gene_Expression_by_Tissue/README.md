# Gene Expression across Human Cells and Tissues

The Gene Expression across Cells and Tissues Appyter takes as input a human gene symbol to produce box plots that display its expression across human cell types and tissues at the mRNA and protein levels.

This appyter utilizes normal tissue gene and protein expression from [GTEx](https://gtexportal.org/home/) [1], [ARCHS4](https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/) [2], and the [Tabula Sapiens](https://tabula-sapiens-portal.ds.czbiohub.org/) [3], the [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download) [4], the [Human Proteome Map](https://www.humanproteomemap.org/download.php) [5], and the [GTEx proteome project](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.036) [6].

GTEx Version 8 [1] and the ARCHS4 Version 11 [2] gene counts were processed to produce gene summary statistics for cell types and tissues. The Tabula Sapiens dataset [3] was processed to produce expression values for all human genes in 469 cell types from 456,101 single cells collected from 14 donors.

Proteomics data were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas [4] with IHC-based expression profiling, the Human Proteome Map [5] with MS-based expression quantification, and a GTEx proteome project [6] using TMT MS.
